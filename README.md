# Covid-19 Binary classification training model using MobileNetV2 

Python training and data model of COVID-19 x-ray image prediction and analysis

Please note before training the model the training data wil need to generated locally by running the appropriate code block in the Jupyter notebook

This will generate a "covid_19_training_data.h5" file which can then be used to train the model.

Training time is approx. 3-4 hrs based on Apple Mac Airbook with 8Mb CPU Ram.

When complete this will geneate a file in the format:

"covid_19_classifier_[timestamp].keras"
